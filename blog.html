    <h3>Roles and Responsibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As we are four member of team we have give every individualto work on three page.</li>
        <li>As Mohit is strong in functionality, Yogeshwari is strong in local storage,Zain is strong in CSS and I my self strong in HTML 
            so we have divided our work in such a way that everyone will get there strong part to work on.
        </li>
        <li>We use to have meet most probably every night to see if any one got stuck on any part,so we can resolve it</li>
       
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>While using GITHub we by mistake done some change in the main branch then again we have correct,this happen just one day before the
            presentation. </li>
            <li>As a part time batch we have very less time to do the project, but we did it</li>
            <li>During merging two pages top navbar page and bottom navbar page we both member have use the same id, so we have to Changes 
                the id of one member it took our whole day to change the CSS property.
            </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Collabartion is most important aspect for any project.During the construct week we understand each other a lot,
    we have debats for certain things,and we have sorted the thing as soon as possible.As we are from the part time batch so
    it very hard to bring every individual at common time and do meet's, so we use to spend our full night in the 
    project and meeting.when everyone is sleeping we are still working hard.
</p>
<br/>
<p>At last we have clone the ESPNcricinfo.com with it's main functionality which we have shown through images.
    The project repository is available on GITHub.
